‫‪Recognition‬‬ ‫‪of‬‬ ‫‪Cosmic‬‬ ‫‪String‬‬ ‫‪location‬‬ ‫‪on‬‬ ‫‪the‬‬ ‫‪CMB‬‬ ‫‪map‬‬ ‫‪by‬‬ ‫‪using‬‬ ‫‪Convolutional‬‬ ‫‪Neural‬‬ ‫‪Networks‬‬ (CNNs)

This repository is a complete model trainig loop to train multi-class models to do a classification task to recognize the exictense of the ‫‪Cosmic‬‬ ‫‪String tension (g_mu) in a given patch of the skymap.

Suggestion: Read [this](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Motahare-Torki/publication/352054373_Planck_Limits_on_Cosmic_String_Tension_Using_Machine_Learning/links/60c06cdb458515bfdb556da4/Planck-Limits-on-Cosmic-String-Tension-Using-Machine-Learning.pdf) paper to know more about the problem and theoretical aspects.

Here, classes are different values of g_mu that you gave it to the data creation part of this repo to make the classes.

To use this repo you should first clone it and do the following two steps:
1. data creation
2. training

follow [this](https://github.com/yashar7799/CS-CMB-CNN/blob/master/CS_CMB_CNN_notebook.ipynb) notebook to know how to go through these steps and use the repo.
